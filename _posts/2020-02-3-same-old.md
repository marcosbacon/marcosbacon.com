Em agosto de 2020 o [Dair Biroli](https://www.biroli.tv/) me convidou, após 10 anos desde o nosso último projeto, a musicar e criar ambiência e folley do seu projeto pessoal de fim de curso.

> SameOld is my graduation film at the Master Institute of Visual Cultures - AKV・St. Joost. Some years after I graduated in Classical Animation at Vancouver Film School, I decided to take another year to study animation, at this time more focused on Storytelling and narrative structures, trying new ways to tell my stories as an independent director. The animated short film is about our connections with technology and brands. The story follows a day of a guy and his caregiver robots in an absurd reality.
